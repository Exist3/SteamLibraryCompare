# SteamLibraryCompare
An application that allows users to compare their steam library with those on their friends list.

# Setup
Before using the software, you will need to acquire two pieces of information. A Steam API key and your Steam ID.
To obtain an API key, you must fill out the form on this page https://steamcommunity.com/login/home/?goto=%2Fdev%2Fapikey
To find your Steam ID, go to this page https://steamidfinder.com/

Once both of these are obtained and you have downloaded the files in this repo, you must create a file called details.txt in the directory.
On the first line of this file, paste your API key and on the second line, paste your Steam ID.

You also need python 3 installed.
